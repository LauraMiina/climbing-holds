# Climbing Holds - A 3d Story
This project was all about experimenting with 3d models as a way to tell a journalistic story.
The goal was to build an explainer about climbing holds and climbing vocabulary for beginner climbers. The explainer was chosen to be done with 3d models so that a beginner climber can stare at realistic holds.

**Tools I learned during this project:**
- The models were created and cropped with Polycam, and the models were brought online with Model Viewer.
- The project utilizes scrolly-telling with D3 and Scrollama libraries.

**The Final Product:**
